# 🎨 Dynamic ASCII Art with Blinking Border & Inverted Colors 🌈

Welcome to the **Dynamic ASCII Art Animation** project! This project creates a colorful ASCII art display in the terminal using C programming. Each loop cycle displays the ASCII pattern with a blinking border and inverted foreground/background colors, giving it a fun and vibrant look! 😊✨

## ✨ Features

- **Blinking Border Effect** 🎉: A colored border frames the ASCII art, and it changes colors in each cycle to create a "blinking" effect.
- **Inverted Colors** 🔄: Each loop alternates between light and dark background colors, with contrasting text colors, making the ASCII art stand out.
  
## 📋 Code Overview

The main components of this project include:
- A loop that cycles through colors for both the ASCII pattern and the border.
- The use of `printf()` statements to set different colors for the ASCII pattern and border.
- `system("cls")` (Windows) to clear the screen between each frame for smooth animation.
  
## 🌐 ASCII Art Source

The ASCII pattern was generated using the tool at [ASCII Art Image Converter](https://www.asciiart.eu/image-to-ascii#google_vignette). 🎨 This site helps convert images to ASCII format, making it easy to bring images to the console!

## 🎉 Customization
Feel free to customize:

- Colors: Change the colors in the colors[] array to experiment with different color combinations.
- Pattern: Replace the ASCII pattern with your own, created using the ASCII Art Image Converter.

## 🛠️ Dependencies
- This project does not require any external libraries. It's built using standard C libraries.
